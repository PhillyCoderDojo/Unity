# 🌈 Project Setup Instructions 🎮

Hello, awesome coder! Ready to embark on an epic coding adventure? 🚀 Let's get your spaceship (aka development environment) ready for launch. Follow these super cool steps to download GitHub Desktop and clone our amazing project repository. 🌟

## Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop 🖥️

First things first, we need to gear up with the right tools. GitHub Desktop is like your digital backpack 🎒 where you'll store all your coding treasures. Let's grab it!

1. Head over to the [GitHub Desktop download page](https://desktop.github.com/) 🌐.
2. Choose the version that matches your operating system (Windows or Mac) and hit that download button! 💾
3. Once the download is complete, open the installer and follow the magical on-screen instructions 🧙‍♂️ to finish setting up.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository 📁

Now that you've got your backpack, it's time to fill it with the project files. These files are like the map 🗺️ and tools 🔨 you'll need for your coding adventure.

1. Open GitHub Desktop. It's like opening the door 🚪 to a world of code!
2. If you haven't already, sign in to your GitHub account. Enter the realm of coders with your secret passphrase (password) 🔐.
3. Click on `File` in the menu bar, then select `Clone Repository` 🌱.
4. In the Clone Repository dialog, tap the `URL` tab to tell GitHub Desktop where to find our treasure chest.
5. Enter the URL of our project: `https://github.com/PhillyCoderDojo/Unity.git` 🏴‍☠️.
6. Choose a special spot on your computer where you want to keep this treasure. This is where the files will live 🏠.
7. Make sure the `main` branch is selected. This is like choosing the main path 🛤️ on our adventure map.
8. Click the `Clone` button to start the magic. The files will magically appear in the spot you chose!

## Step 3: Switch to the Correct Branch 🔄

If you find yourself on the wrong path, don't worry! You can easily switch to the `main` branch, our main adventure route.

1. In GitHub Desktop, make sure our project is the chosen one ✨.
2. Click on the current branch name at the top. This is like checking your current location on the map 🗺️.
3. In the drop-down menu, find and select the `main` branch. This is like choosing the right path in a magical forest 🌳.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Woohoo! You've successfully set up your coding adventure base. Now, you're ready to explore, create, and make magic happen in the world of code. Remember, every great coder commits their changes and shares them with the world. So, regularly commit your amazing work and push it to GitHub 🌍.
